title: Breaking Down the Future, One Tomorrow At a Time

---
We want to bring together experts from diverse fields to have a radical discussion about the future. Our goal is to establish a think tank that challenges existing narratives by imagining, formulating, and shaping alternative perspectives and stories about the future.

Our first step this year will be to gather for a focused 4-day retreat, where we will share and engage with one another’s disciplines, insights, and hopes and fears about the future. Alongside this we will utilize science fiction future scenarios to develop together visions of desirable tomorrows and forge the paths to realize them. In the months following the retreat, we will work collaboratively on writing and producing policy, design, stories, media and art that clearly marks these paths, allowing us to set out towards different desirable futures.

## Why Should We Design Tomorrow/s?

The purpose of this series of workshops is to move the discussion about the future from the realms of isolated, one-off, didactic discussions and presentations and into more communicative, distributed, and readily available outputs like short stories, graphics, policy papers, and more. This stems from the understanding that the future should be something we do and think about together.

The formats of a lecture, a panel or a talk capture an important part of how we think about the future but leave out more collaborative aspects. Ultimately, unlike the future, they have a starting point and an ending point. Their long term impact is unclear and hazy at best.

Things that we make together tend to survive for longer and leave more of an impact on our future. The reason for this is simple: by putting our heads together, we create something with more perspectives, more variety and, thus, more adaptability; just like in nature, ideas which are open to change and to fitting themselves into whatever may come next, tend to survive and, eventually, proliferate.

This has always been true of good science fiction especially; where it has been hard, rigid, and conservative, it has faded away. Where it has been elegant, flexible, and truly audacious, it has persevered and even come to impact the future about which it was written.

## How Does Designing Tomorrow/s Work?

In its current form, Designing Tomorrow/s takes shape as a **Focused Retreat** made up of three main methodologies.

This workshop, spanning a couple of days, will gather a larger number of participants from fields such as writing, forecasting, design, graphics, policy, and more into a “pressure cooker” type of workshop.

### Four Futures

**Replace the text below with info on Four Futures**

The participants will divide themselves into four groups (method of division TBD, might be organic and natural or a bit more planned). Each of these groups will focus on one of the four “story seeds” created during the previous workshop. The future vision from which the backcasting methodology will begin, will be one of the story seeds from the initial workshop but will of course be open to interpretation and tweaking by the group. They’ll need to make that future their own.

### Backcasting

**Update the text below with info on Backcasting**

Utilizing the backcasting methodology (a planning method that starts with defining a desirable future and then works backwards to identify policies and programs that will connect the future to the present), each group will analyze and chart out the road from this future and back to our present day. They will do so in discussion and with mentors, slowly building together the changes and checkpoints our society must undergo in order to reach that future.

The output from this workshop will be a flowchart of the passage from the future back to our present. We leave it to the groups to decide how to present this flowchart: they can do so by displaying their raw work (post its, diagrams, and so on), by creating something more abstract to represent or any other method they deem fit. In any case, we will supply individuals capable of charting a more “traditional” flowchart for each group and, preferably, upload it to a website.
